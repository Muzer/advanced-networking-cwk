Broadcast: name + identifier
	others respond with usernames and identifiers (eg IP address)

Every X seconds, broadcast sending username + identifier

If after X * Y seconds, an identifier update hasn't come from <user>, drop their name-identifier mapping

To message a user, lookup their identifier and send to it.
